ASP.Net Self Hosted API
===================

Self Hosted ASP.Net Web API for local machine testing


This is an application you can build to do self hosted testing of API calls within an application. I generated this code for an article on my blog, [Create a Self Hosted API for Local Development](http://www.jeremymorgan.com/blog/programming/how-to-create-asp-self-hosted-api/). It can be used for local machine development and testing by creating a fake but functional API to write against.
